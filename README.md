# deeplearning_pytorch

This repository contains notebooks I use to exercise with deep learning using PyTorch. The focus here is on computer vision, in particular on classification tasks. Some contents are :

* training simple convolutional networks, 
* implementation of more complex architectures (ResNet, DenseNet),
* usage of pretrained models for fine-tuning or feature extracting.
