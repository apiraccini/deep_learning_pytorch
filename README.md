# Deep learning - Computer vision

This repository contains notebook I use to exercise with deep learning. The focus here is on computer vision, in particular classification tasks. Some contents are training simple convolutional networks, implementation of more complex arcchitectures (ResNet, DenseNet), usage of pretrained models for fine-tuning or featuure extracting.
